/*
Because of the time required to burn data to EEPROM a file cannot simply be downloaded at 57.6kB
The speed can be reduced considerably or the file can be downloaded several times.
It was felt that the latter approach generated less hassle for the user and has been adopted here.
Each time the file is downloaded in full but only 256 chars or less are stored to an array in SRAM.
When this array is full its contents are copied to EEPROM.

The text/data file contains several sections.  Explanatory text if required appears first.
Strings are then placed between a pair of -"- characters.
After this data can be apended and all text such as data names for example is ignored.

The following variables are used to keep a track of this process:


"EEPROM_buffer"	Array into which file text and data is downloaded before being saved to EEPROM
"EEP_pointer"	and 	"*ptr_EEP_pointer"		Address of next free location in the EEPROM
"file_pointer"	and		"*ptr_file_pointer"		Address in text/data file being downloaded from PC
"array_pointer	and		"*ptr_array_pointer"	Address of next free location in array (temp storrage for file)
"data_counter"	and		"*ptr_data_counter"		Counts data items as they are downloaded	
"DL_flag"		and		"*ptr_DL_flag"			Status of download
"DL_status"		and		"ptr_DL_status"			Status of download

"reservation"	Used to enter the amount of EEPROM required by the application which should not be used for text/data
"op_code_1"		Read, write or delete
"op_code_2"		Specifies format used for reading back numbers from the EEPROM


Note the following bug:		It appears that text strings are always downloaded consistently.
							If numeric data is also stored there seem to be up to 3 consecutive addresses for the first byte.
							The middle address appears to be used most of the time
							But every now and then one of the other adresses is used.
							Obviously this recks the operation of the client program used to read the EEPROM unless it is noticed
							and an appropriate offset of plus or minus 1 added to the data addresses.
