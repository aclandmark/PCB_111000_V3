/*********************

COMPILE using OPTIMIZE level (-01) only (was -Os in winAVR)

The ATMEGA 328 is programmed with the mini-OS in the application partition 
and the bootloader in the boot section using "mini_OS programmer"

Note: the term bootloader refers to a pcb bootloader not an IC bootloader
		It should more strictly be called a programmer

*EEPROM reservations
0x3FF	user cal if set
0x3FE	user cal if set
0x3FD	Default cal supplied by Atmel
0x3FC	If 'x' pressed at p/r prompt 0x3FC is set to 1 for diagnostic mode.
		if 'r' is pressed, normal mode runs
0x3FB	Controls brightness
0x3FA	No longer used
0x3F9	Set to 1 by programmer to trigger auto calibration;
0x3F8	EEP_subs  PRN_8bit_GEN().
0x3F7	Spare for PRN_8bit_GEN() (in case pf burn-out)
0x3F6	Reserved??
Zero to 0x3F5: For user strings and data
